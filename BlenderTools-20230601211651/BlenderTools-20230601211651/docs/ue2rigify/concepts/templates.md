Let's talk about templates in UE to Rigify.

Using the mannequin as an example again, you can see If you hit `Convert`, that a Rigify "Control" rig is created
that drives the original "Source" rig.

This is possible because of a predefined template for the unreal mannequin character that is selected from the
template dropdown. This template contains all of the relationships and the bones necessary to create this rig.

If I wanted to create a new template, I could go over here to this template panel and I could click `create new`.

You can see that it adds in one of the default Rigify meta rigs.

So basically, how this process works is you pick one of these default Rigify meta rigs and use one as a starting point.

You name it, and then click `Save Metarig`.

Now I am back in "Source" mode. If I click this delete button, I can remove this template.

Also, you can import templates from an external file. To demonstrate this, I'm going to switch over to another file
where I have another character.

The unreal mannequin template is not going work with this. So I need to import the template that was made for this
character. I'm going go over to the header menu and select `Edit > Preferences > Addons > UE to Rigify`. Here you can
see there is an import template and export template import template.

I'm just going import this template file from disk.

![10](./images/templates/10.jpg)

Now if I click `Convert`. You can see that the rig is generated from this template, and it all matches up because
this template has been created specifically for this character.

Now let's say we made modifications to this characterâ€™s template and we want someone else to be able to use it. All
we have to do is go to `Edit > Preferences > UE to Rigify` and `Export Template`.

![12](./images/templates/12.jpg)

You can select which template you want to export in the side panel of the export window.

That is how you can use templates in "UE to Rigify"!
