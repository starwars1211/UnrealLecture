# Community Templates

UE to Rigify templates are a powerful way to share rigs and retarget animation regardless of
what app the skeleton and skin weights were originally created with. As the number of templates created grows,
we want this page to be filled with links to templates that the community has authored, and can hopefully help others
with their blender and unreal pipelines.
