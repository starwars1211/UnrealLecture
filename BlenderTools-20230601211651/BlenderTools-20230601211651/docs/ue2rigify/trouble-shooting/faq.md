# FAQ

### How can I share a template I created with another artist?
Go to Edit > Preferences > Addons > UE to Rigify and select ‘Export Template’. From the sidebar in the file window
select the template you want to export. Then select the location on your hard drive and click `Export Template`.
They can now click ‘Import Template’ and select this file, then click ‘Import Template’.

### How can I use a Rigify metarig as the source rig?
If you want to use the tool to drive a rig you made in blender that is a Rigify metarig template, you need to rename
it. You should stay away from the names "metarig" and "rig" because those are Rigify reserved names and when UE to
Rigify generates a new rigify rig, those could get stomped on. Thus, renaming the metarig you added as your source
rig is necessary for this to work.

## Where are Rig templates stored?
Rig templates are stored within:
- windows: `%TEMP%\ue2rigify\resources\rig_templates`
- unix: `/tmp/ue2rigify/resources/rig_templates`
