# Paths
The `Paths` section of the settings dialog is where all export and import paths can be configured.  There are several
different paths available depending on which `Path Mode` is selected:

## Path Modes
Select which path mode Send to Unreal should use.

### Send to Project
Sends the intermediate files to a temporary location on disk and then imports them into
the Unreal Project. This doesn't require any extra configuration, but might not be ideal if your intermediate files
need to be under source control.

### Send to Disk
Sends the intermediate files to a specified location on disk and does not import them.

### Send to Disk then Project
Sends the intermediate files to a specified location on disk and then imports them into
the Unreal Project. This requires extra paths to be configured, but is ideal if your intermediate files
need to be under source control.

## Relative Paths
When specifying a location on disk with either the `Send to Disk` or `Send to Disk then Project`, relative paths
can be used if the blender file is saved.  The paths are relative to the currently open blender file.

::: tip Note
  A relative disk path is relative to where the blend file is saved on disk.
