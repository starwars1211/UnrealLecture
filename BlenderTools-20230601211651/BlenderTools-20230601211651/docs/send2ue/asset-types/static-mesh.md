# Static Mesh

Static meshes are simple. The tool looks in the `Export` set for objects of type `MESH` and sends them to unreal as
individual Static Mesh assets to unreal.

In this example, you can see the result is two Unreal Static Mesh assets along with their material.

## LODs

LOD workflows for static meshes are supported. Simply activate the LODs option in the LOD Settings group and Send to
Unreal will handle exporting and importing each LOD.

::: tip Note
  If your mesh has a LOD naming scheme and Import LODs is true, the LOD postfix will get stripped out of the final asset name based on the lod regex. For
example:

`pCube1_LOD0 = pCube1`

`pCube2_lod0_mesh = pCube2`
:::

Also notice that the LOD build settings can be set under the
`Import > Editor Settings > Static Mesh LOD Build Settings` group.

::: tip Note
  The Editor Settings corresponds to what is available in the [EditorStaticMeshLibrary](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/PythonAPI/class/EditorStaticMeshLibrary.html) in the Unreal Python API:

## Collisions

Simple collision workflows for static meshes are supported by prefixing your collision names with their respective identifiers and making them a child of the mesh.
| Mesh Prefix and Name | Description |
| -------------- | ----------------------- |
| `UBX_[RenderMeshName]_##` | A Box must be created using a regular rectangular 3D object. You cannot move the vertices around or deform it in any way to make it something other than a rectangular prism, or else it will not work. |
| `UCP_[RenderMeshName]_##` | A Capsule must be a cylindrical object capped with hemispheres. It does not need to have many segments (8 is a good number) at all because it is converted into a true capsule for collision. Like boxes, you should not move the individual vertices around.|
| `USP_[RenderMeshName]_##` | A Sphere does not need to have many segments (8 is a good number) at all because it is converted into a true sphere for collision. Like boxes, you should not move the individual vertices around. |
| `UCX_[RenderMeshName]_##` | A Convex object can be any completely closed convex 3D shape. For example, a box can also be a convex object. |

The underlying mechanism for this is the Unreal FBX importer, so for further information, please refer to the [FBX Guide for static meshes](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/WorkingWithContent/Importing/FBX/StaticMeshes/).

Collisions are imported with the asset that matches the `[RenderMeshName]` after the collision prefix.

::: tip Note
  Collisions must be in the `Export` collection to be exported.

## Sockets

There is a supported workflow for adding sockets to static meshes.

![8](./images/static-mesh/7.png)

Any child mesh that has the pre fix `SOCKET_` in its name will be separately imported as a socket of its parent.

::: tip Note
  Socket names have the `SOCKET_` prefix stripped out. `SOCKET_socket_01` in blender becomes `socket_01` in unreal.

## Only Mesh

To run a strictly mesh asset import (ex: excluding import of particle systems as groom assets), all import options
must be turned off in your [import settings](/settings/import.html) except for `Mesh`.
