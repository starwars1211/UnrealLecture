## Overview

<img :src="$withBase('/images/overview.svg')" alt="overview">


The reason our tool can provide a "one-click" solution for these assets is because it can automatically infer the correct unreal asset type based on just the contents of a single `Export`
collection. That, along with giving the user the ability to customize and share settings templates, allows assets and scenes to be completely configured ahead of time.
A saved file can be opened by an artist and in one-click they can have their assets in unreal engine. The main purpose of this tool
is for rapid iteration and standardization of asset workflows. If you are interested in learning more, please read through the rest of our documentation
starting with our [quickstart guide](./introduction/quickstart)
