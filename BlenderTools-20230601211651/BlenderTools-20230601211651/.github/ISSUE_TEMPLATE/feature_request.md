## Feature
### IMPORTANT: Do this before you create a feature ticket!
  1. Search the Documentation.
  1. Watch all the videos in the documentation.
  1. If the action you are trying to do is currently not possible, or you think a pretty good case can be made for having a specific set of actions automated, create an issue with a **'discussion'** label so other users can chime in and discuss the new workflow the new feature. 
  1. Once the workflow is agreed on create a new feature issue close by copying the info below. Leave links to the new feature issues, and then close the discussion issue.

Create a **Title** with the addon name first i.e. UE to Rigify - ```<your title>```

### In the description paste in and edit the following:
* **Addon:** i.e UE to Rigify
* **Workflow:** i.e. Select a bone, then hit a hot key and get a pie menu with 2 options.
* **Description:** i.e. For this two work you would need to create 2 new operator that are specific to only the 3D view... etc.
